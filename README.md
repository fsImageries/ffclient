# FFClient

## About

FFClient is a web-based ffmpeg console.
It has presets to use it as a simple media converter but is intended to be used like an command-line program.
The UI is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and uses [ffmpeg.wasm](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm) to realize all conversions.

You can visit it [here.](https://fsimageries.github.io/ffclient/)

## Usage

Upload any kind of media file (Video, Image, Audio) and enter a necessary command.
You can use the preset switches to generate commands automatically from you uploaded files.
